# ChatBots
Chatbot Hub is a centralized collection of diverse AI chatbots — from lightweight local models like Ollama and LM Studio, to advanced RAG-based assistants and future experimental bots.
This repository serves as a playground for exploring, comparing, and building conversational AI systems using different frameworks, architectures, and model backends.
